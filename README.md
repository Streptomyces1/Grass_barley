Data analyzes from microbiome data from Barley fungicide greehouse experiment
#Terrestrial Ecology Department, Technical University of Munich

In a greenhouse full factorial experiment, we investigated the effects of prothioconazole and fluoxastrobin 
fungicide irrigation, of inoculation of the pathogenic fungus Drechslera teres and of barley cultivars on plant
growth and grain yield variables, and particularly on barley root endophytic communities. Our experimental
design was an approach to real agriculture practice, where generally fungicides are irrigated prophylactic
before occurrence of pathogenic fungi. Additionally, aphid abundance has been measured. 60 root samples with 
all treatment combinations were chosen for DNA-extraction, PCR amplification and metabarcoding. For beta diversity
analysis, multivariate statistics had been performed to reduce the large data sets into few principal coordinates 
in a MDS-CAP ordination. We hypothesized that the fungicide treatment will affect alpha and beta diversity in bacterial
and fungal endophyte communities. It was found, that the fungicide and Drechslera treatments had no significant effect
on alpha and beta diversity of the endophytes, but barley cultivar showed to be a significant driver of beta diversity
of bacterial and fungal barley root endophyte communities.
